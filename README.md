# Microsoft Movie Studios: Movie Analysis
Authors: Imani Thompson and Phil Lannoo 
# Overview
This project analyses which directors and genres Microsoft Movie Studios should consider when producing movies based on the ratings each recieved. Descriptive analysis of IMDb movie data shows that some directors have higher ratings on their movies compared to others and certain genres also have higher ratings. Microsoft movie studios can use these findings to hire outstandings directors to produce movies that everyone will enjoy.
# Business Understanding
Microsoft Movie Studios is looking to enter the industry to quickly become the most used streaming service. Microsoft has no restrictions on the costs or time that this will be required but is more concerned with providing their clients. We are supplying Microsoft Movie Studios with a pathway for sucess that leads to what they are looking for.
# Data 
# Results
# Conclusions
This Data analysis leads to three recommendations that will allow Microsoft Movie Studios to come out as being the most popular streaming service in business:
- Look to hire directors who have made at least 5 productions that have high ratings.
    - Directors who are dominating in the film industry are more likely to provide you with well loved movies.
- Focus on hiring directors that have a high ranking
    - An average ranking of 8.0 or higher leaves 37 options, 7.0 or higher leaves 428 options.
- Let the directors work in genres they've done well in in the past.


# Next Steps
Future ideas for an continuation of this project:
- Look at addition metrics for movie actors 
    - Having well known experienced actors would be a benefit that would lure people to these movies.
- Look at addition metrics for movie writers
    - Yes, directors are important since they have control but writers are the people who create the piece from scratch. Involving writers would also be beneficial.
- Look at coinciding genres
    - This project focused on individual genres so considering that many movies are associaed with more than one genres, looking at grouped genres would give another view.
